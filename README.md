## emacs config
Just clone this dir to ~/. You may need to delete your current .emacs and .emacs.d first. I have not looked into a smart way to back up .emacs.d dirs, so this may currently contain a lot of crap that isn't needed. To rebuild all packages after cloning do `M-: (byte-recompile-directory package-user-dir nil 'force)`.
